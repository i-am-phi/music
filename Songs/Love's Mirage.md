Love's Mirage

Lonely hearts
beating fast
hoping that 
this will last

but it's not real
it's just what lovers feel

silly thoughts
foolish notions
under spells
magic potions

but it's not real
it's just what lovers feel

it's not real
it's just what lovers feel

all along I played the game
running from the blues
a sudden song with sweet refrain
lonely hearts can't loose

silly smile
side ways glance
do you think
take a chance

but it's not real
it's just what lovers feel

it's not real
it's just what lovers feel

all along I played the game
running from the blues
a sudden song with sweet refrain
lonely hearts can't loose

oh lonely hearts can't loose

silly smile
side ways glance
do you think
take a chance

but it's not real
it's just what lovers feel

it's not real
it's just what lovers feel
