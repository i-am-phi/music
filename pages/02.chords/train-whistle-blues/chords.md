A
When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
D                                                         A
When a woman gets the blues she hangs her little head and cries
           E7                                      A
But when a man gets blues he grabs him a train and rides

Looky yonder coming coming down the railroad track
D                                            A
Looky yonder coming coming down the railroad track
            E7                                              A
And see the black smoke rolling rolling from that old smoke stack

Every time I see that lonesome railroad train
D                                            A
Every time I see that lonesome railroad train
            E7                                              A
And see the black smoke rolling rolling from that old smoke stack

D                                              A
I feel so bad that the whole round world looks blue
               E7                         A
I ain't got no money I don't know what to do

D                                              A
I can't understand how come you do me like you do do do do do
            E7                                            A
