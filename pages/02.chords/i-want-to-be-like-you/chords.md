I WANT TO BE LIKE YOU

[Intro]
Am E7 Am

[Verse]
    Am                                          E7
Now I'm the king of the swingers oh, the jungle VIP
    E7                                                         Am

  Am                                            E7
I wanna be a man, mancub, and stroll right into town
    E7                                                  Am     G7
And be just like the other men, I'm tired of monkeyin' around, oh

[Chorus]
C                           A7
Oo-bee-doo, I wanna be like yoo-ooo-oou
        D7              G7            C
I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too-ooo-ooo
       G7       C                         A7
You'll see it's true-ooo-ooo, an ape like me-ee-ee

[Verse]
Am                                                  E7

     E7                                                Am
What I desire is man's red fire, to make my dream come true
    Am                                                E7
Now give me the secret, mancub, c'mon clue me what to do
     E7                                                 Am   G7
Give me the power of man's red flower, so I can be like you, oh
