G7       C     G7  Cdim  C     C Dm7 Cdim C
Won't you come along with me

C         Dm7         C7   G7+5      C    Bb  G7+5
Down that Mis - sis - sip - pi;

C            C7           F       Fm
We'll take a boat to the land of dreams,

C     G/B       Am7  Bb9     G7     C    G
Steam down the river down to New Orleans.



    C      G7       Cdim  C     C Dm7 Cdim C
The band's there to greet us,

C     C7          G7   G7+5      C    Bb  G7+5
Old friends will meet us,

C         C7     F       Fm
Where all people like to meet

C     C/B   Am7      Am7/G    G7     C      G7
Heaven on earth, they call it Basin Street


C      C/B   E7
Basin Street is the street

A7         A7/9 A      A7
Where the elite always meet --

   D       Am7   D9      G7
In New Orleans, land of dreams

        C9    C       CM7      Cdim
You'll never know how nice it seems

    Dm7      Em7     F7     G
Or just how much it really means.



C      C/B   E7
Glad to be, yessiree,

      A7       A7/9   A      A7
Where welcomes free, dear to me,

      F      Dm7 G7   G7/6  G7  G7/6    C    C  F Fm Bb9  C
Where I can lose    my Ba - sin Street Blues.
