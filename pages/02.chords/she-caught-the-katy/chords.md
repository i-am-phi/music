[Verse 1]

A                   E                      A
She caught the katy, left me a mule to ride
A                   E                      A
She caught the katy, left me a mule to ride
A
She caught the katy, left me a mule to ride
D                               Dm
The train polled out and I swung on behind
A                    E                         A
Crazy 'bout her, that hard-headed woman of mine


[Verse 2]

A                   E                      A
Man, my baby long. Great God, she mighty, my baby tall
A                   E                      A
You know my baby long. Great God, she mighty, my baby tall
A
Well, my baby, she long. My baby, she tall.
D                               Dm
She sleep with her head in the kitchen
And her feet's out in the hall
A                    E                         A
Crazy 'bout her, that hard-headed woman of mine

[Bridge]

        D
Well, I love my baby. She's so fine
A
   Wish she'd come and see me sometime
            G
She don't believe I love her, look what a hole I'm in
            E
She don't believe I'm sinking, look what shape I'm in


[Verse 1]

A                   E                      A
She caught the katy, left me a mule to ride
A                   E                      A
She caught the katy, left me a mule to ride
A
She caught the katy, left me a mule to ride
D                               Em
The train polled out and I swung on behind
A                    E                  D                        A
Crazy 'bout her, that hard-headed woman, hard-headed woman of mine
