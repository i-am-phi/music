Walkin' with my baby she's got great big feet

She's long, lean, and lanky and ain't had nothing to eat
             F                            C
But she's my baby and I love her just the same
       G                                      C
Crazy 'bout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her name

         C
Caldonia, Caldonia - What makes your big head so hard?
  F                             C
I love her, I love her just the same
       G                                      C
Crazy 'bout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her name

Now, my mamma told me to leave Caldonia alone
             F
Said she was bad for my moral
                                               C
But mama didn't know what Caldonia was puttin' down
And that she was such a nice gal
        G
So, I'm going down to Caldonia's house
                 C
And ask her just one more time

C
Caldonia, Caldonia - What makes your big head so hard?
F                             C
I love her, I love her just the same
G                                      C
Crazy 'bout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her name
