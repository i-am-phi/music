Walkin' with my baby she's got great big feet

She's long, lean, and lanky and ain't had nothing to eat
             F                            C
But she's my baby and I love her just the same
Crazy 'Gbout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her Cname

Caldonia,C Caldonia - What makes your big head so hard?
I Flove her, I love her just the Csame
Crazy 'Gbout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her Cname

C    F    C    G    C
CNow, my mamma told me to leave Caldonia alone
Said she was Fbad for my moral
But mama didn't know what Caldonia was puttin' Cdown
And that she was such a nice gal
So, I'm Ggoing down to Caldonia's house
And ask her just Cone more time

Caldonia,C Caldonia - What makes your big head so hard?
I Flove her, I love her just the Csame
Crazy 'Gbout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her Cname
