Oh when the saints,  go marching in.
                            G7
When the saints go marching in.
  C                  F
I want to be, in that number.
         C         G7       C
When the saints go marching in.



And when the sun, refuse to shine.
                           G7
And when the sun refuse to shine.
        C                  F
I still want to be, in that number.
         C    G7       C
When the sun refuse to shine.



Oh when the saints,  go marching in.
                            G7
When the saints go marching in.
    C                        F
I'm gonna to sing, as loud as thunder.
            C         G7       C
Oh when the saints go marching in.
