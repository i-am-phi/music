[Verse 1]



D               A                 G              D
He is now to be among you at the calling of your hearts 

D                              A  
Rest assure this troubadour is acting on His part 

D                 A                 G              D
The union of your spirits here has caused Him to remain 

D                                   A
For whenever two or more of you are gathered in His name 

          G              D   E7 G D
there is love, there is love



[Verse 2]



D                           A              G             D
Well, a man shall leave his mother and a woman leave her home 

D                                A 
They will travel on to where the two shall be as one

D                A             G             D
As it was in the beginning, is now until the end

D                                 A
Woman draws her life from man and gives it back again

             G                 D   E7 G D
And there’s love, oh, there's love





[Bridge]



G                                      D
Well then what’s to be the meaning for becoming man and wife

G                              D
Is it love that brings you here or love that brings you life

D                    A           G                D
For if loving is the answer then who's the giving for

D                                A
Do you believe in something that you've never seen before

          G                  D   G E7 D
There is love, oh, there is love

Oh the marriage of your spirits here has caused Him to remain

D                                    A
For when ever two or more of you are gathered in His name

          G              D   G E7 D   D G E7 D
There is love, there is love
