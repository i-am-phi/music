 G   E

                  E7
Up the lazy river by the old mill run
    A                      A7
The lazy lazy river in the noon-day sun
  D                      D7
Layin' in the shade of a kind old tree
  G              G                            G7
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream with me

E                           E7
Up the lazy river where the robin's song
 A                             A7
Awaits a bright new mornin' as we just roll along
 C              C7     G            E
Blue skies up above, every one's in love
A           D          G              E
Up the lazy river, how happy we would be
A           D          G
Up the lazy river with me
