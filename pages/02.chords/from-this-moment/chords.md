[Verse]

          G                  D
From this moment, life has begun

          C       D  
>From this moment, you are the one

      C                       G
Right beside you is where I belong

Am        D      G   
From this moment on.



[Verse]

          G                   D
From this moment, I have been blessed

       C        D    
I live only for your happiness

        C                           G 
And for your love, I'd give my last breath

Am        D      C
From this moment on.



[Chorus]

  G                                C 
I give my hand to you, with all my heart

      D                                    G            
Can't wait to live my life with you, can't wait to start

G                        C 
You and I will never be apart

   Em          C      G        D
My dreams came true because of you.

    

[Verse]                                                (modulate up 1 whole step)

          A                    E
From this moment, as long as I live

       D           E 
I will love you, I promise you this

         D                  A 
There is nothing I wouldn't give

Bm        E      D
From this moment on.



[Instrumental]

A   F#m   D    E



[Chorus]

A                              D
You're the reason I believe in love

    E                                        A
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above

A                              D
All we need is just the two of us

   F#m         D      A        E (rest, and slap that capo on fret #4)
My dreams came true because of you.

I will love you, I promise you this

         C                  g
There is nothing I wouldn't give

Am        D
From this moment



       C                      G
I will love you as long as I live

Am        D      C    G3    D    G   
From this moment on.
