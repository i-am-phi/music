D  D9 D   G          G6      F          Dm7       G       G7
I got a heart that's broken heart - ed, how do I mend it?

         C9            G/B               C7      D7
I got a crying jag you started, how do I end it?

But if you're feeling gloomy, come a-running to me --

 G        B7        E7 Bm7-5 Am7   D7
Meet me where they play the blues.

 D   D9   D    G           G6        F       Dm7       G       G7
Peo- ple have said they've seen you dance in hideaway places;

  G          C9            G/B                   C7      D7
People have said you find romance in other's embraces.

    G        G6    G    E7      C      Am7     Cm
But if your feel - in' dreamy, and you care to see me,

 G      Bm7-5      Am7 Cdim   G
Meet me where they play the blues.


[Bridge]

           G    Cdim    G7      G      Cdim   G7
Eyes that flirt with a tear are common round here,

    C9           Am            CM7   CM7/6
And misery loves company, they say;

          A    Em7   A7   Em7        A      Em7  A7
So I'll linger 'til dawn while the trumpet wails on

 Am7         Cdim          D7
Hopin' you'll happen this way.

D   D9     D    G       G6       F       Dm7          G       G7
I'm get - tin' tired of sippin' wine and watchin' it bubble;

 G           C9               G/B                   C7      D7
How did our dreams get out of line and wind up in trouble?

     G      G6  G       E7       C        Am7         Cm
But, honey, if you're yearnin' there's a flame still burnin' --

G        B7         E7 Bm7-5 Am7   D7
Meet me where they play the blues.

 G           C9               G/B                   C7      D7
How did our dreams get out of line and wind up in trouble?
