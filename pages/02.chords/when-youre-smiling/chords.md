When You're Smiling
written by Joe Goodwin, Larry Shay, Mark Fisher

G
When you're smiling when you're smiling 
                E7          Am
The whole world smiles with you 
                            
When you're laughing oh when you're laughing 
    D7                G
The sun comes shining through 

                           C
But when you're crying you bring on the rain 
             A7         D7
So stop your sighing be happy again 
        G                         E7
Keep on smiling cause when you're smiling 
    Am          D7          G
The whole world smiles with you 

 
When you're smiling when you're smiling 
                E7          Am
The whole world smiles with you 
                            
When you're laughing oh when you're laughing 
    D7                G
The sun comes shining through 

                           C
But when you're crying you bring on the rain 
             A7         D7
So stop your sighing be happy again 
        G                         E7
Keep on smiling cause when you're smiling 
    Am          D7          G
The whole world smiles with you
