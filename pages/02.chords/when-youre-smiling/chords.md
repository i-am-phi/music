G                                Gmaj7
When you're smiling when you're smiling
                E7          Am
The whole world smiles with you

When you're laughing oh when you're laughing
    D7                G
The sun comes shining through

                G7          C
But when you're crying you bring on the rain
             A7         D7
So stop your sighing be happy again
        G                         E7
Keep on smiling cause when you're smiling
    Am          D7          G
The whole world smiles with you
