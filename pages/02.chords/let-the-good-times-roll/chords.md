[Verse 1]
Hey everybody
Let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead you're done

[Chorus]
So let the good times roll
I said let the good times roll
I don't care if you're young or old
You ought to get together and let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
Don't sit there mumbling
Talking trash
If you want to have a ball
You got to go out and spend some cash

[Chorus]
And let the good times roll now
I'm talking about the good times
Well it makes no difference whether you're young or old
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

[Verse 3]
Hey y'all tell everybody, ray charles in town
I got a dollar and a quarter and i'm just ringing the clock
But don't let no female, play me cheap
I got fifty cents more than i'm gonna keep

[Chorus]
So let the good times roll now
I tell y'all i'm gonna let the good times roll now
Well it don't make no difference if you're young or old
All you got to do is get together and let the good times roll

[Outro]
Hey no matter whether, rainy weather
If you want to have a ball, you got to get yourself together
Oh, get yourself under control, woah, and let the good times roll
