[Verse 1]
C                                  G
Goodbye, Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh.
                                       C
Me gotta go, pole the pirogue down the bayou.
                                  G
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh.
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

[Chorus]
                                           G
Well jambalaya and a crawfish pie and filé gumbo
                                      C
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
                                    G
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

[Verse 2]
C                                    G
Thibodaux, Fontaineaux, the place is buzzin',
                                  C
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen.
                                         G
We dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh.
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

[Chorus]
                                           G
Well jambalaya and a crawfish pie and filé gumbo
                                      C
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
                                   G
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

[Chorus]
C                                          G
Well jambalaya and a crawfish pie and filé gumbo
                                       C
Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio.
                                    G
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar and be gayo,
                                        C
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.
