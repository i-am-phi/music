It's early in the morning and I can't get right
                                               E7
'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night
A
Now it's early in the morning
E
It's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to all the places where we used to go

I went to her house but she don't live there no more

And it's early in the morning

It's early in the mornin

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out

I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout "Get away from here!"

Too early in the morning

It's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues


[BREAK]


Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat

The waitress looked at me, she said, "Man, you sure look beat"

It's early in the morning, baby

Early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



Had a lot of money when I first started out

I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out

Now it's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



It's early in the morning

I ain't got nothin' but the blues
