        E
Well now when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
         A                                           E
Well now when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
    B7                             A                    E        B7
When the blues overtake me, gonna rock right away from here

        E
Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
    A                                  E
Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
        B7                       A                 E              B7
Well, I call my baby, tell her I'm on my way back home

E
Well, flip, flop & fly

I don't care if I die
A
Flip, flop & fly
                  E
I don't care if I die
B7                    A                  E                       B7
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

         E
Give me one last kiss; hold it a long, long time
        A                                   E
Give me one last kiss; hold it a long, long time
      B7                     A                       E            B7
Well, hold that kiss 'til I feel it in my head like wine

E
Here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
A                                      E
Here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
B7                            A              E                B7
She's so small she can mambo in a pay phone booth

       E
Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
        A                                       E
Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
       B7              A                        E           B7
I got so many women I don't know which way to jump
