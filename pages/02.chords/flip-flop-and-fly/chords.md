FLIP, FLOP & FLY

        E
Well now when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
         A                                           E
Well now when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin' chair
    B                             A                    E        B
When the blues overtake me, gonna rock right away from here

        E
Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
    A                                  E
Now when I get lonesome I get on the telephone
        B                       A                 E              B
Well, I call my baby, tell her I'm on my way back home

E
Well, flip, flop & fly

I don't care if I die
A
Flip, flop & fly
                  E
I don't care if I die
B                    A                  E                       B
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

         E
Give me one last kiss; hold it a long, long time
        A                                   E
Give me one last kiss; hold it a long, long time
      B                     A                       E            B
Well, hold that kiss 'til I feel it in my head like wine

E
Here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
A                                      E
Here come my baby, flashin' a new gold tooth
B                            A              E                B
She's so small she can mambo in a pay phone booth


E
Well, flip, flop & fly

I don't care if I die
A
Flip, flop & fly
                  E
I don't care if I die
B                    A                  E               B
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye

       E
Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
        A                                       E
Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
       B              A                        E           B
I got so many women I don't know which way to jump

E
Well, flip, flop & fly
                        
I don't care if I die
A
Flip, flop & fly
                E
I don't care if I die
B                    A                  E               B
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
